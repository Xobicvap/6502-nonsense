# 6502-nonsense
So, I've always been fascinated with 6502 assembly, mainly because 1) as a child I always wanted to be able to make Nintendo games, and the NES runs off a 6502, and 2) my first computer was an Apple IIe (more accurately, this thing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_128). 

In fact, the first programming I ever did WAS 6502 assembly. I didn't have access to half the documentation I have now, so my first forays into it were kind of limited and mostly mixed with a lot of hideous, slow Applesoft BASIC. So okay, BASIC was my first language, but it doesn't count.

I started hacking on Apple IIe stuff again recently, and decided to start posting my little side projects here in case anyone else is interested in this sort of thing.

If there's interest, I might push some of my ancient, mostly seizure-inducing NES demos from 10-15 years ago. Anyway, enjoy.
